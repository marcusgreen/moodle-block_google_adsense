Put full /google_adsense directory on /blocks directory, log as admin and wait auto install 
to make changes on database. Make sure you don't have any adblocker installed in your browser, 
or the ads will be blocked (unsurprisingly)

Tested mainly with Moodle 2.0 and slightly with Moodle 2.1 I believe it will work OK up to at least Moodle 2.4. It is designed around text adverts, I have no idea if and how it would work with graphical adverts.
